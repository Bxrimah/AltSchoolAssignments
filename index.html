            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Kweku Barimah, a passionate learner with a background in computer science.<br>
                I am currently enrolled in the <i>ALT School of Engineering</i> program, where I am honing my skills
                in software development and engineering practices.<br> I have a keen interest in full-stack
                development, and I am excited to learn more about building scalable and efficient applications.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I grew up in Accra, Ghana, where my curiosity for technology sparked at a young age.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always been fascinated by how software can solve real-world problems and improve
                people's lives.<br> This passion led me to pursue a career in software engineering, where I
                aim to create innovative solutions that make a difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages, contributing to open-source
                projects, and staying updated with the latest trends in technology.<br> I believe that continuous
                learning is essential in this ever-evolving field, and I am committed to honing my skills
                to become a proficient software engineer.
